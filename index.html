                    <p class="newsreader-regular">While tech stocks have dominated the market in recent
                        times
                        and the hottest new tech - AI
                        is foremost in everyones minds, (consumer) technology has not felt more discordant or perhaps
                        even
                        <a href="https://a.co/d/5zzO7Wk">dystopian</a>. The very platforms that were meant to build
                        connections and enable borderless communication to a degree that humanity could have scarcely
                        imagined before, are <a
                            href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/twitter-facebook-social-media-decline/672074/">addictive,
                            caustic and divisive</a>. The front page of the internet is <a
                            href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-search-quality-decline-productivity-3507610/">an
                            unusable</a> <a href="https://www.the215guys.com/blog/google-search-sucks-now/">mess</a> and
                        the
                        company behind it is being <a href="https://www.usvgoogleads.com/">sued for monopolistic
                            practices</a>. And this is just for starters. Even if you set aside the head line grabbing
                        stuff, the day to day reality is just so unhealthy - attention is at an all time low. Though I
                        have
                        no social media, I often catch myself stuck in a doom scroll of YouTube Shorts. One can only
                        imagine
                        how much worse it is for the average person with Instagram, FaceBook, TikTok, Snapchat etc.
                    </p>
                    <p class="newsreader-regular">I remember back in the &#39;00s when the internet was first becoming
                        widely available, it was such an
                        incredibly exciting thing to go online. BB forums, IRC chat rooms, RSS feeds, Yahoo Messenger,
                        Google circles even. It was a magical time. The internet felt more open, less
                        controlled/manufactured and just more genuine. The early internet was ironically however
                        considered
                        to be generally untrustworthy especially when it came to information. Yet, we now find ourselves
                        now
                        drowning in more information, misinformation and disinformation. This might be what finally
                        breaks
                        the internet for most people - with AI, generating content indistinguishable from reality means
                        that
                        we can fully expect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory">dead
                            internet
                            theory</a> to become real. This reality has also mutilated the hardware and devices we use.
                    </p>
                    <p class="newsreader-regular"><em>Where do we go from here?</em></p>
                    <p class="newsreader-regular">This is not a thing that affects some of us in some superficial way -
                        it
                        is affecting all of us in an
                        extreme but perhaps not so obvious way. Electronics are an inextricably a foundational part of
                        modern society and is as important a thing as any that exists. But i&#39;m not here to sell you
                        on a
                        tale of gloom! &quot;Problems are just an opportunity in disguise&quot; as they say and in this
                        case, not just an opportunity but an incredible call to action. Creating change is an incredibly
                        incredibly hard thing to do. Thus the arrival of a disruptive technology where new capabilities
                        are
                        unlocked and existing paradigms are challenged are golden opportunities - and not to be missed!
                        We
                        are luckily in the midst of 3 revolutionary technologies (AI, XR and decentralized protocols‚Å∫).
                        I
                        believe the confluence of these will enable a far better paradigm. </p>
                    <p class="newsreader-regular">Sitting in room, hunched over a laptop, sifting through google results
                        to
                        get to ad infested pages to
                        glean whats the best vacuum cleaner to buy... can now instead become a stroll through the park,
                        walking the dog while conversing with an AI assistant. </p>
                    <p class="newsreader-regular">Journaling, again hunched over a desk or a computer (and doing so
                        infrequently as its a time
                        intensive, unergonomic and annoying task) can instead be a hike in the woods dictating notes
                        without
                        being constrained by the medium and maintaining emotional content, ability to edit and update.
                    </p>
                    <p class="newsreader-regular">Jumping from app to app to order a meal from your favorite restaurant
                        and
                        plugging in your credit
                        card information to yet another site, can now instead be as simple as a text or voice command.
                    </p>
                    <p class="newsreader-regular">But these things are not a given, these new technologies like all
                        before
                        them are not somehow
                        inherently good. In fact, they very well could be used to further perpetuate the bad paradigms
                        that
                        exist. And that&#39;s where we come in - realizing this new vision requires people to believe in
                        it,
                        build it and fight for it. And the reality is that its not some grand challenge or final boss to
                        beat but just mindful, intentional product design and the many, seemingly minor decisions that
                        go
                        into it. Do it right and we can have it all - ergonomics, a way out of sinking in information,
                        work-life balance, the existence nay the thriving of democratic society, you name it.</p>
